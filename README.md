• React Elements:
Task 1 :
   Create a basic React element to display a static heading "Task Manager".

• React Element Attributes: 
Task 2 :
   Use `className` and `id` attributes in HTML elements to apply styles or target specific elements within your React component.

• React Element Styles:
Task 3 :
   Apply inline styles (using the `style` attribute) to a task card for dynamic styling based on task completion (e.g., completed tasks are marked with a green background).

• React Fragments: 
Task 4 :
   Use `React.Fragment` (or `<> </>`) to wrap multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

• React Components: 
Task 5 :
   Create functional components for `TaskList`, `TaskItem`, and `TaskForm` to manage different sections of the app.

• React Props: 
Task 6 :
   Pass task data (like title and description) as props to the `TaskItem` component, and render it within the component.

• React Children Props:
Task 7 :
   Use `children` to pass dynamic content into components, such as passing a button or additional details into a task component.

• React Conditionals: 
Task 8 :
   Use conditional rendering to show a "No tasks available" message if there are no tasks, or display the list if tasks are available.

• React Lists: 
Task 9 :
   Use `.map()` to render a list of tasks dynamically from an array of objects.

• React Context:
Task 10 :
   Create a `TaskContext` to manage global state for tasks (such as adding or removing tasks) and pass the context through your app using the `Context.Provider`.

Additional Requirements:
• Use `useState` for managing the tasks state in the app. 
• Add a form to add new tasks and a delete button to remove tasks. 
• Optionally, style the components using CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
